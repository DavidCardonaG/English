      "PHONETICS",
      "Phonetics is the science that studies speech sounds in a language, how they are produced, perceived, and their acoustic properties. It analyzes the physiological processes of sound production and the points of articulation.",
      "Articulatory features describe how sounds are produced based on the speech organs. These include:",
      "• Place of articulation: The location where the sound is produced (e.g., bilabial /p/, dental /t/).",
      "• Manner of articulation: The way air flows when pronouncing the sound (e.g., plosive /b/, fricative /f/).",
      "• Voicing: Whether the vocal cords vibrate or not (e.g., voiced /d/, voiceless /t/).",
      "________________________________________",
      "PHONOLOGY",
      "Phonology examines the rules that govern sound realization in a language, identifying relevant distinctions and analyzing how these sounds function in different contexts of speech.",
      "Suprasegmental features affect larger units than phonemes, such as syllables or words. These include:",
      "• Stress: The intensity with which a syllable is pronounced (e.g., 'record' [noun] vs. 'record' [verb]).",
      "• Intonation: Variation in pitch within a sentence (e.g., rising intonation for yes/no questions).",
      "• Duration: The length of time a sound or syllable is pronounced."
